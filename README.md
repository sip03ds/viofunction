# Using a Logic App with Azure Durable Functions for automating Device Synchronization among MS Products (Azure Active Directory - Endpoint Manager - Autopilot - Defender for Endpoint).
I have worked for an group organization that has many subsidiaries. 
Every subsidiary has its own IT department that should have a different degree of freedom for performing actions on Cloud MS Products. 
All companies exist under the same tenant.
Let's say that we have:
- Central IT
- Company A IT
- Company B IT

## Need: 
We want to have Endpoint Management Administrators for **Central IT** , **Company A** IT Administrators managing their devices and **Company B** IT Administrators managing their devices. 
We want to automate synchronization of device assignment and user under each "administrative realm" (administrative unit in AAD terms , Scope Tags in MEM terms, Deployment Profile for Autopilot, Tagging in MDE terms). 

## Assumptions: 
- Each company has its own domain name that is reflected on the UPN e.g. user@centralit.com, user@companya.com , user@companyb.com
- Each computer of each company follows a specific naming pattern 
- We have all necessary licenses (Azure AD P1 , E3 , E5 Security in my case) 
- We can register applications on AAD
- We can create and manage an Azure Key Vault
- We can create Azure Durable Functions 
- We can create logic apps on Azure
- InTune, MDE and AAD are already configured & integrated
- You are aware of MS Graph API, MS Security Graph API, Managed Identities
- You are familiar with coding and JSON (in my case I am using Java 11 and JSON)

## Scope: 
- **Azure Active Directory**
- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

## Deployment: 

Based on AAD RBAC Roles: 

![AAD RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/media/concept-understand-roles/role-overlap-diagram.png)

We will create different Groups of Users that will be shared among the administration patterns of each product.
We will leverage on **specific attributes** for managing users and devices and link them. 

### Azure Active Directory Configuration (AAD)
AAD is the basis of our implementation we will create 3 administrative units per company
For Company A:
1. "IT Department of Company A - Devices" - *Dynamic Membership*
2. "IT Department of Company A - Users" - *Dynamic Membership*
3. "IT Department of Company A - Groups" - *Assigned Membership*

The first two (1) & (2) administrative units would have dynamic membership rules.
Obviously, the 1st one contains devices and the 2nd one contains users. 
The last one (3) is assigned.

More over we then create a group per company. For Company A, we name it "IT Department of Company A" and it contains all administrators of Company A.
This group can be Dynamic , Privileged Access Group (if you want to use Privileged Identity Management). 

Each device is distinguished under each administrative unit by **device category** attribute on Graph API for AAD ([https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices](https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices))

    "azureAdDeviceId": "0d7fe7c6-6437-4b36-8678-6f98b1031f6e",


### Microsoft Endpoint Configuration (MEM)
On Endpoint Configuration Manager we create a Scope Tag per company.
For Company A, we name it "IT Department of Company A". 

Each device is distinguished under each scope tag by **device category** attribute on Graph API for Managed Devices ([https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices](https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices))

"id": "ac753f45-dc86-421b-8fe8-cde09e8a498a",

"deviceCategoryDisplayName": "IT Department of CABLEL",

"azureADDeviceId": "ddf37b4e-f68b-4add-a164-881b7bbe6504",

### Autopilot Configuration
On AAD create create a dynamic group for devices per company. 

On Endpoint Configuration Manager we create an autopilot profile per company.
The profile deploys a specific naming pattern (e.g. compapc001 - company a pc 001) for each device. 

Graph API for Autopilot Device([https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/windowsAutopilotDeviceIdentities](https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/windowsAutopilotDeviceIdentities))

Each device is distinguished under each scope tag by **Serial** and 

"id": "8ac4e717-f429-4091-854c-6a1b60a90912",   --> [ZTDID]@AAD
"azureActiveDirectoryDeviceId": "b81c8159-2b09-40ad-915c-fc726886bad2",

"serialNumber": "0000-0003-4209-7652-2425-8798-38",
 
### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Configuration (MDE)

Security Graph API for MDE([https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/machines/](https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/machines/))

"id": "0002a344412985ce8629d2ea979f98d57449b243",
"computerDnsName": "stlpmavrakis.corp.vionet.gr",
"aadDeviceId": "888d2c94-b23c-4b8c-b25b-e878aad0b6e2", AADDeviceID (not object Id)
"machineTags": ["IT Department of STEELMET"],

## Linking the devices among AAD, MEM , Autopilot and MDE

Using the attributes for each entity we attempt to make the links displayed on the following figure:
![Entity Links](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

The white links display out of the box connections used by the products.
The yellow links display the conceptual link we will try to create using strings for distinguishing each company. 

## Automating Linking

### Logic App

### Registering an App

### Securing access to the app using Keyvault

### Durable Functions to overcome Logic Limitations or Long running transactions using Async HTTP API

### Email notifications or MS Teams message posting
